- jasmine examples:
  - hello world of testing (slide one)
    - arrange, act, assert
    - slide_spec_one   
    - expect: the engine of jasmine
    - some common expectations:
        - toBe
        - .not.toBe (any questions?)
        - toEqual
        - toMatch (regex)
        - toBeDefined (literally the least you can do)
        - toBeTruthy 
        - toBeFalsy
        - toContain
        - you can define your own.
  - test runners  
    - SpecRunner.html is pretty common, grunt + phantomjs is great too. (see Aaron's full stack preso)
  - workflow: make testing frictionless as much as possible
    - tests shouldn't interfere
    - tests shouldn't be long running
    - test one thing at a time

- whoami: 
  - i kinda know jasmine, nUnit, cucumber, specflow, but I'm not an expert
  - i'm not a hardcore node user, but that doesn't matter.  TDD/BDD/ATDD is not
  about the tech stack
- it's not about the tests - it's about what the tests lead to
    - posit: good unit testing practices result in good code. 
    - why?  
      - decomposition: if you're testing units, you're more likely to develop 
      small, single purpose functions and modules. 
      - the act of testing units of code requires you to 
      abstract services used by the code under test.
        - this leads to:
          - at least: services that do one thing.
          - usually: loose coupling amongst services.
          - ideally: IoC/DI mechanisms that support 
      - parsimony/thrift: extreme unwillingness to spend money or use resource
        - if you can't test it, do you need it? (YAGNI)      
  - side effects :
    - documentation
      - easy to read code is great... but...
      good unit tests document the intent of the design
    - reliability
      - find unintended side effects
      - support refactoring.  if you trust your test suite you can make
      large changes with a higher certainty that you haven't broken anything
      - detect bugs - what you might think would be the primary purpose for unit 
      testing.
- what should you test?
  - test when you're not sure how to proceed
  - test mission-critical code, even if you do know how to proceed
  - test exposed methods of modules.
- what you don't need to test:
  - hackathon code
  - someone else's code
  - view-ish things: assume IE will always be the same amount of awesome.  Assume that
  if a view breaks you'll notice.

ideas:  
  - can I wire test runner up as a preso engine
