- whoami: 
  - 
  - i kinda know jasmine, nUnit, cucumber, specflow, but I'm not an expert
  - i'm not a hardcore node user, but that doesn't matter.  TDD/BDD/ATDD is not
  about the tech stack

- audience:
  - who knows jasmine/mocha/xUnit/cucumber/rspec/?

- why test (why bother)?    
  - it's not about the tests - it's about what the tests lead to
    - posit: good unit testing practices result in good code. 
    - why?  
      - decomposition: if you're testing units, you're more likely to develop 
      small, single purpose functions and modules. 
      - the act of testing units of code requires you to 
      abstract services used by the code under test.
        - this leads to:
          - at least: services that do one thing.
          - usually: loose coupling amongst services.
          - ideally: IoC/DI mechanisms that support 
      - parsimony/thrift: extreme unwillingness to spend money or use resource
        - if you can't test it, do you need it? (YAGNI)      
  - side effects :
    - documentation
      - easy to read code is great... but...
      good unit tests document the intent of the design
    - reliability
      - find unintended side effects
      - support refactoring.  if you trust your test suite you can make
      large changes with a higher certainty that you haven't broken anything
      - detect bugs - what you might think would be the primary purpose for unit 
      testing.
- what should you test?
  - test when you're not sure how to proceed
  - test mission-critical code, even if you do know how to proceed
  - test exposed methods of modules.
- what you don't need to test:
  - hackathon code
  - someone else's code
  - view-ish things: assume IE will always be the same amount of awesome.  Assume that
  if a view breaks you'll notice.

- examples:
  - hello world of testing
  - test runners

ideas:
  - present using jasmine
  - can I wire test runner up as a preso engine







describe("this preso", function(){
    

    beforeEach(function(){
        // some transition
    });

    afterEach(function(){
        // exit transition
    });

    it("should have")

});
